# Character Codes

This is a mod for Keep talking and nobody explodes which adds a module called character codes. 
Adds a module which is all about reading wierd sombols from a display and then converting them into a number. Although the display can be a bit difficult to read.

The manual can be found [here](https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Character%20Codes.html).

Created using the [ktane modkit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit).
